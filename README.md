# Work Day Planner
In this assignment I was given starter code with basic HTML and CSS. Using jquery, moment.js, and Javascript; I was able to make the planner function with the following criteria:

- Have day of the week and date display at the top of the page
- Show schedule with standard business hours and color coded time blocks
- Have the data stay after refreshing the page by incorporating local storage
